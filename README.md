### Description
In this project, we use an Airbnb new users booking dataset to predict the usersâ€™ country destination. The dataset come from a previous [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data). Airbnb enables people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. Since 2008, Airbnb has 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries, serving more than 60 million users. Analyzing new online user behavior is valuable for generating user specific recommendations, improving the booking success rate and customer retention rate. In this project, we will use the user session data provided by Airbnb to predict user's booking destination. There are 11 unique destination counties in the dataset. We will use user's profile information (such as gender, age, account created date etc) and user's session data (such as action, action type, etc) to classify the destination country.
